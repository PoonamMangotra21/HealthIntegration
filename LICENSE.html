notices from the Source form of the

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of

addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that such 
additional attribution notices cannot be 
construed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as modifying 
the License.</SPAN></P>

license terms and conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for use, 
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, 
or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reproduction, and 
distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
with<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the conditions stated in this 
License.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.

of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License, without any additional terms 
or conditions.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the above,

terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Licensor regarding such 
Contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.

required for reasonable and customary use in describing 
the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origin of the Work and reproducing the 
content of the NOTICE file.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. 
Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law

Work (and each<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express 
or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of TITLE, 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR 
A<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely 
responsible for determining the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume 
any<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; risks associated with Your exercise of 
permissions under this License.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. 
Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether in tort (including 
negligence), contract, or otherwise,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless 
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; negligent acts) or agreed to in 
writing, shall any Contributor be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liable to 
You for damages, including any direct, indirect, 
special,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incidental, or consequential damages 
of any character arising as a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use 
the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work (including but not limited to damages 
for loss of goodwill,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, or any and all<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other 
commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Accepting 
Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Work or Derivative Works 
thereof, You may choose to offer,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and charge a 
fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License. 
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act 
only<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of any other 
Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defend, and hold each Contributor 
harmless for any liability<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incurred by, or 
claims asserted against, such Contributor by 
reason<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of your accepting any such warranty or 
additional liability.</SPAN></P>
